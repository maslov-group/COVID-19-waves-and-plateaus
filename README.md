# Dynamical model and Agent-based model for the stochastic social behavior coupled to COVID-19 dynamics 
This Jupyter notebook and Matlab code contain the agent-based model and the dynamical model theoretically derived from the stochastic differential equations for the paper "Stochastic social behavior coupled to COVID-19 dynamics leads to waves, plateaus and an endemic state". The Jupyter notebook contains all the necessary codes for the agent-based model simulation and then shows that the simulation results agree with the predictions from the dynamical systems theoretically derived in the paper. The Matlab code provides the model that is fitted to the US regional deaths.
